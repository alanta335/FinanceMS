// This file is now a stub. The main Reports component has been moved to ./Reports/index.tsx
// To fix the import error, update your imports to use './components/Reports' (the folder) instead of './components/Reports.tsx'.
// If you need a default export for legacy reasons, re-export from index.tsx:
export { default } from "./Reports/index";
